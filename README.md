# Crop Prediction App

This application is designed to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts in predicting the most suitable crops based on environmental conditions. By leveraging machine learning, the app helps users make informed decisions for better crop yield and resource management.

## Features

- **Supports 22 Crops**: Predicts suitable crops from a variety of 22 options, helping users maximize productivity based on local environmental data.
  
- **Input Parameters**: Users can input key agricultural metrics such as:
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Phosphorus (P)
  - Potassium (K)
  - Temperature (Â°C)
  - Humidity (%)
  - pH level
  - Rainfall (mm)

- **Accurate Crop Recommendations**: The app processes the input parameters and provides an accurate prediction of the most suitable crop to grow under the given conditions.
